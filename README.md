# Consensus-despite-link-failure
This will simulate the randomized algorithm for consensus despite links failures using java
The input for this problem consists of (1) n (the number of processes of the distributed system which is
equal to the number of threads to be created), (2) r (the number of rounds the algorithm is to run for),
(3) x, an integer whose significance is described below; and (4) one array inputval[n] of size n; the i
th
element of this array gives the input value of the process i. The master thread reads input file input.dat
containing these four inputs and then spawns n threads. The file input.dat is a text file and process ids
are equal to the indices. [process ids are 1, 2, …, n and ith process had id i.]. Between every pair of
processes, there is a direct link. [Communication network is a completely connected graph.]
Every process knows n, process 1 is the leader and every xth message is lost (not delivered).
For message loss, all messages are numbered as follows: In the first round, the message from process 1
to process 2 is message number 1, the message from process 1 to process 3 is second message,
message from process 1 to process n is the n-1
st message, the message from process 2 to process 1 is
the nth message, etc. This numbering is only for the purpose of deciding which message will be
dropped at any round. These “counters” are NOT reset at the end of each round.
At the end of executing the algorithm, each process should output its id, its decision value, and its level
vector. Make sure that each process’s output is printed “in tact.” (One process’s output cannot be
interleaved with that of another process’s output.)
